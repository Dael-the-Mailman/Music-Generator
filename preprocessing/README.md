# Preprocessing

## MP3 to WAV

> [mp3towav.py](./mp3towav.py)

Converts .mp3 files into .wav files

This was created due to my computer being unable to process the .mp3 files I gathered

## Train, Validation, Test Split

> [train_val_test_split.py](./train_val_test_split.py)

Splits the .wav files into training, validation, and test folders

This was created because I forgot to do it in mp3towav.pyðŸ˜›

## Save waveform

> [save_waveform.py](./save_waveform.py)

Turns the .wav file into a pytorch tensor file

**NOTE: Abandoned due to large file sizes**
